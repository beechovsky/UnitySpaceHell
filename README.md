Unity Space Hell Project - Protoype 

This is a game project, protoyped here in Actionscript/Flash, that is currently being developed in Unity. It will be a top-down , "bullet-hell" focused on maneuvering a starship around asteroids, alien weapons, and the like. Challenges include: a finite fuel supply, replenished only by reaching planets/space stations; the aforementioned obstacles of space rocks(asteroids and meteroids) and hostile lifeforms; mastery of the control system, a simple "swipe" system for both acceleration and banking left or right. 

In addition to the fuel obtained at each plant/space station, the player will begin receiving power-ups/upgrades
such as shields, augmented fuel tanks, and weapons. 

The story is one of mass exodus from a dying/depleted planet, centered on the pilot of the massive spaceship upon which 
the homeless colony resides.
